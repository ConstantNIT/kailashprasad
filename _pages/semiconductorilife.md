## Semiconductor - Life

### MOSFET

Our life is like the journey of MOSFET. Since its inception there were challenges. But it kept on improving despite that. There were hurdles every decade and people thought this the end but you know what it kept on improving and gave the performance. There was a time when tunneling become dominant and felt like it's done now but a slight change in the attitude (Oxide) changed the whole game. Later to prove everyone wrong it got out of its comfort zone and gone from 2D to 3D. Still, the number of people talking about death MOSFET has increased more exponentially than Moore's Law but MOSFET is still there and it will be.

So Keep believing yourself and overcome challenges like a MOSFET.
