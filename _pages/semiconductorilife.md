## Semiconductor - Life

### MOSFET

Our life is like the journey of MOSFET. Since its inception there were challenges. But it kept on improving despite that. There were hurdles every decade and people thought this the end but you know what it kept on improving and gave the performance. There was a time when tunneling become dominant and felt like it's done now but a slight change in the attitude (Oxide) changed the whole game. Later to prove everyone wrong it got out of its comfort zone and gone from 2D to 3D. Still, the number of people talking about death MOSFET has increased more exponentially than Moore's Law but MOSFET is still there and it will be.

So Keep believing yourself and overcome challenges like a MOSFET.

### Negativity

There is a lot of negativity around you, and so does with our semiconductors. But the point is current cannot flow without electrons. So to let negativity to aid you in success, you have to be the Potential.

More the negativity, the higher the Potential.

### No excuse
Sometimes you have to cross the barrier and Sometimes you have to tunnel through it. Either way you reach the destination. And sometimes you should break the barrier.

### Tunelling
Be like an electron. Despite all the scattering and barriers, it goes from source to destination. But sometimes when the barrier is too high instead of crossing it tunnels through it.

### Electron
A high density of electrons results in a current flow but at the same time single electron in a NAND Flash can create a difference.
